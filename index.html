    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>The city traces its long colorful history to the Old Town of Polo, then part of the province of Bulacan, which was established in 1623. It began as a tiny settlement of fishermen along the coast of Manila Bay. Polo was later renamed Valenzuela, in honor of its most famous son, Dr. Pio Valenzuela, one of the triumvirates of the Katipunan (revolutionary movement during the Spanish occupation). In 1975, it formed part of Metropolitan Manila after its creation. It became a city in 1998 when President Fidel V. Ramos signed RA 8526, an act passed by congress, as authored by the late Congressman Antonio M. Serapio, classifying Valenzuela as a highly urbanized city

        Valenzuela, The Vibrant City, once a quaint provincial town during the colonial times, is now regarded as one of the country's most liveable cities, and among the preferred residential, cultural and business destinations.
        
        Today, it is considered as a hub of governance best practices and innovations as evident by the accolades it has been receiving from numerous reputable award-giving institutions; such as the Galing Pook Awards, Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index, Seal of Good Financial Housekeeping, and Most Business-Friendly City Award, among others..</p>
